> **Note:** the SDL2 UI is deprecated in favor of the Webview one. It won't receive updates.


## Using the binary

[Lem has nightly releases](https://github.com/lem-project/lem/releases) (Linux AppImages, MacOS and Windows binaries), but not for the SDL2 GUI.


## Installation from scratch

Dependencies:

- [sbcl](https://www.sbcl.org/)
- [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [qlot](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Install SBCL and SDL2 libraries

- **Debian**-like distro

```
sudo apt install sbcl build-essential  fd-find libgtk-4-dev libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev
```

- **Fedora**-like distro

```
sudo dnf install sbcl fd-find gtk4-devel webkitgtk6.0-devel
sudo dnf group install c-development development-tools
```

- **MacOS**: install WebKit.

- **Windows**:

```
    WebView2 from NuGet.
    Windows libraries: advapi32 ole32 shell32 shlwapi user32 version
```

- **FreeBSD**:

```
pkg install sbcl webkit2-gtk4
```


### Install qlot

- Automatic installer

```
curl -L https://qlot.tech/installer | bash
```

> **Note:** For an alternative installation, see https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot#installation

### Build

```
git clone https://github.com/lem-project/lem.git
cd lem && make webview
```


Optionnally, do:

```
sudo make install
```

This will:

- Install the executable system-wide
- Add a desktop entry file with relevant file associations
- Configure webview as the default interface

You can still switch between interfaces using the `-i / --interface` option when launching Lem.

## MacOS

### How to Fix “App Is Damaged and Can’t Be Opened” on OSX
Copy the app file to the applications folder and type the following in your terminal:
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/lem.app
```
### Make it an Application

To create an executable that you can run as a GUI you will need to use Automator.

- Launch Automator
- Choose 'Application' as the type for your document

You should now see three columns. In the second column there will be a collection of actions
that you can run in this 'application'. Scroll down until you see `Run Shell Script`. Double click
on this and on the right you should now see a text box where you can enter your script:

Replace the contents of this shell script with the following:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
cd ~/common-lisp/lem
./lem -i sdl2 &
exit 0
```

Save this as an application (this should be the default) with the name `Lem` to `\Applications`.

You should now be abel to run this as an application from the Applications folder.

## Japanese Industrial Standard keyboard layout

If your keyboard is a JIS layout, you need to put the following settings in `$HOME/.lem/init.lisp`

```common-lisp
#+lem-sdl2
(lem-sdl2:set-keyboard-layout :jis)
```
