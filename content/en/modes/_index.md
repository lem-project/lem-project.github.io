Lem supports many programming languages out of the box.

Below are also listed special Lem modes, such as the `directory` mode,
Lem's `dashboard`, or again markup and configuration modes.

Lem strives to support even more languages, popular or emerging ones. We can follow the progress
[on this meta-issue](https://github.com/lem-project/lem/issues/2066).
